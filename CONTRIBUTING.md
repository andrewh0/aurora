# Contributing

Thanks so much for considering contributing to Aurora!

This is a small side project, so the contributing guidelines generally pretty loose.

If you'd like to fix something or add a new feature, create an issue first to see if a pull request is needed. If so:

- Fork this repo
- Cut a feature branch from master
- Make changes to the feature branch
- Merge in any upstream changes
- Submit a pull request to this repo

I'll review the code and either request changes or merge. Thank you!
